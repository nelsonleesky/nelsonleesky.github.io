Before beginning this project, I had no experience in website development or coding. I wasn't even sure about which platform to use for creating my site. I considered options ranging from simpler solutions like Google Sites to more personalized but costly alternatives like Squarespace. It was through the recommendation of my friend, Chiemeka, that I began exploring alternative methods of site creation, which led me to discover GitHub.


Further researching online, I discovered that while there is an initial learning curve in basic web coding, utilizing Jekyll and GitHub is a widely recommended approach. Seeing this as an opportunity to expand my skill set, I embraced the challenge. 

Through extensive online resources, including video tutorials, forums, and blogs, as well as the support from my friends who patiently helped me with my endless amount of questions, I gradually grew my knowledge. I learned what exactly VS Code, GitGub Codespaces, version control with Git, CSS files, and various web development tools and concepts actually were and how to efficiently utilize them. I also acquired basic HTML coding skills throughout this process. Overall, this experience proved to be immensely valuable, and I now have a greater appreciation for both website design and coding.

Using GitHub, I forked the <a href="[URL](https://jekflix.rossener.com/)">Jekflix</a> Jekyll theme by Thiago Rossener as a starting point and extensively customized it to create my personal website.
