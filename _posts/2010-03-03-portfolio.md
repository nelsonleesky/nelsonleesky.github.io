The @uclaesports post is an event announcement I assisted in designing and posting during my time as the Marketing Coordinator for UCLA's official esports team. The announcement was also promoted on Facebook and Twitter.

In my role as a Social Media Marketing Intern at Friends Collection, I contributed to the design and creation of the @friendsplushies post, which showcases one of the newest plushies in the Friends Collection lineup.

## Fashion Cents Paid Advertisement

During my social media marketing internship at Friends Collection, I was tasked with creating a paid advertisement for their upcoming board game at the time, Fashion Cents. I was given full creative direction in the production of the advertisement. 

I decided to highlight the game's most distinctive features: its unique art and goofiness. Knowing that the video was intended for Instagram Reels and Facebook—platforms where capturing and maintaining viewer attention is quite difficult—I implemented a fast-paced approach, ensuring each shot featured engaging visuals.

## Sample Post from Fashion Cents Reddit Campaign

During my time at Friends Collection, I also frequently created and facilitated Reddit posts to raise awareness and gather feedback for Fashion Cents among our target audience. The Reddit post above is an example of one of these efforts.

## 48 Hour Video Creation Challenge: <br>Honda Accord Advertisement

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14miL0qN-zwIILDM0-gUNXz_7ZW3lGda_/preview" width="760" height="427.5" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

I created this video as part of a recruitment challenge. Given 48 hours, I was tasked with creating a video that showcased my editing skills. To align with the role's focus on content creation for product showcases, I chose to produce an advertisement for my car. You can watch the final video below:

The 2011 Honda Accord is not known to be the fastest, newest, or most stylish car. However, it is well-renowed for its reliability, with many lasting up to 200,000 to 300,000 miles. I decided that leveraging this reputation would be a great focus for my advertisement. Additionally, I decided that emphasizing my car's appeal as more than just a vehicle would be a great focus as well. Through close-up shots and slo-motion sequences during golden hour, accompanied by an uplifting and comforting soundtrack, I aimed to portray my car as a character with qualities of dependability and trustworthiness. These two qualities are cornerstones of a great companion, and I hoped to convince potentential buyers that my car can become just that for them.

## Resident Advisor Appa Poster

During my time as a resident advisor at UCR Residential Life, I was responsible for choosing a theme for the dormitory hall I oversaw. I decided on the show "Avatar: The Last Airbender", as I knew that it was popular enough for many of my incoming residents to be familiar with. To implement this theme into my hall, I created this large 4x2 feet graphic of Appa, a character from the show.
