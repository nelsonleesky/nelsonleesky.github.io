Hi! I'm Nelson, a senior psychology student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2016 at the age of 14. It was during this transition that my passion for psychology began, as I was taken aback at how differently people behaved in my new environment. From the little things, such as the foods they found appetizing, to more complex subjects, such as faith, gender roles, and morality. My passion compounded when I became self-aware of my own evolving thoughts and behaviors throughout my time adapting in my new environment. By the time college applications came around in high school, I wasn't completely sure of what career path I wanted to pursue. However, I was convinced that psychology was the perfect academic direction for me.

Upon entering university, I joined two psychology research labs, the Biobehavioral Research Lab led by Dr. Chandra Reynolds and the Adversity and Adaption Lab led by Dr. Tuppett Yates. My experiences there were invaluable, and I saw myself potentially pursuing a career in research and academia. However, it wasn't until I took on the role of Resident Advisor that I began to understand which career path I truly wanted to pursue. This position required strong communication, problem-solving, and creativity skills, all of which aligned well with my natural abilities. Unexpectedly, I found that frequent analysis of human behavior, particularly that of my residents, was crucial for success in this role.

For instance, I was regularly tasked with hosting events for my residents and ensuring high attendance rates. To achieve this, I needed to make these events as appealing and approachable as possible. I could attract residents by highlighting the opportunity for new friendships and networking, or I could alleviate their fear of feeling left out by incorporating team games that encouraged interaction. Understanding my residents' motivations and concerns was essential to engaging them effectively.

This experience led me to a significant insight about the craft of marketing. I recognized that marketing is a strategic discipline that involves the identification, understanding, and engagement of target audiences to achieve specific business objectives through creativity and problem-solving. This aspect of my role as a resident advisor—strategically engaging my audience—was what I found most compelling. Recognizing the alignment between these skills and the field of marketing, I became convinced that **this** was the career path I wanted to pursue. Since then, I have actively worked in roles to grow my skillset in this field, and I am always seeking new opportunities to continue my development.

Outside of my professional life, I am passionate about fitness, basketball, and fashion. I enjoy spending time with my friends, family, and my dog, Tea. I also have a personal goal of reading one book each month, focusing on either self-help or memoirs, in order to foster personal growth and broaden my perspective. My personal favorite so far would be <I>Atomic Habits</I> by James Clear, as its practicality and straightforward writing often serve as a reference for improving my behavior. Currently, I am reading the <I> The Creative Act: A Way of Being</I> by Mark Rubin, and I have a great appreciation for its unconventional format and the insights it provides.
