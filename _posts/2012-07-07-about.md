Hi! I'm Nelson, a senior psychology student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia, and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2016 when I was 14 years old. It was during this transition that my passion for psychology began, as I was taken aback at how differently people behaved in my new environment. From the little things, such as what foods they found appetizing, to complex subjects such as faith, gender roles, and morality. My passion compounded when I became self-aware of my own evolving thoughts and behaviors throughout my time adapting in my new environment. By the time college applications came around in high school, I wasn't completely sure of what career path I wanted to pursue. However, I was convinced that psychology was the academic direction that was perfect for me.

> A picture of me with the team at the BioBehavioral Research Lab.

Entering university, I joined two psychology research labs, the Biobehavioral Research Lab with Dr. Chandra Reynolds and the Adversity and Adaption Lab with Dr. Tuppett Yates. My experiences there were nothing short of amazing, and I saw myself potentially pursuing a career in research and academia. However, it wasn't until I began my position as a Resident Advisor that I began understanding what career path I truly felt aligned with. The position required strong communication, problem-solving, and creativity skills, all of which came naturally for me. What took me by surprise was the frequent analysis of human behavior, especially my residents', that was required for me to succeed.

For instance, I was regularly tasked with hosting events for my residents and ensuring a high attendance rate. In order to accomplish this, I had to figure out how to make these events as attractive and unintimidating as possible for them. I could appeal to their desire for the prospect of new friendships with many networking opportunities in an event, or I could decrease their fear of potentially feeling left out when attending by ensuring it guarantees team games involving heavy interaction. I had to understand my residents' motivations and fears to reach them effectively.

This process of identifying how to reach a target audience to achieve a specific goal is essentially what the field of marketing entails, and I realized that **this** was the career path I wanted to pursue. Since then, I have actively worked in roles to grow my skillset in this field, and I am always actively seeking new opportunities to continue my development.

Outside of my professional life, I am passionate about fitness, basketball, and fashion. I love spending time with my friends, family, and my dog, Tea. I also have a personal goal of reading one book every month, either a self-help book or a memoir, in order to grow personally and widen my perspective. My personal favorite so far would be <I>Atomic Habits</I> by James Clear, as its practicality and straightforward writing have made me often use it as a reference when figuring out how to alter my behavior for the better. Currently, I am reading the <I> The Creative Act: A Way of Being</I> by Mark Rubin, and I have a great appreciation for the unconventional format it utilizes and insights that it provides me.
